# Coding Competition Attempts

Archive of solutions for coding competitions I've participated in.
Not necessarily the solutions I came up with during the competition.
For the most part, answers are cleaned/rewritten and commented after the competition is over to be more easily used as an informative resource.
Not all questions may be attempted during the competition. Some questions may be attempted after the competition is over for the sake of learning.
